# Medical-Nanotech--Multilayered-Composite-Nanofiber-Scaffold-Embedded-with-Drug

**Problem Statement**

The high prevalence of cardiovascular diseases has resulted in a significant demand for small-diameter grafts, which cannot be met through the use of autologous vessels. While synthetic vessels of medium to large diameter are currently available, the unique dynamic environment of small vessels has made it challenging to develop a suitable small-diameter graft. The ideal tissue-engineered graft must closely match the mechanical properties of native tissue while being non-thrombotic and non-immunogenic. It should elicit the appropriate healing response and undergo remodelling to integrate with the native vasculature for long-term patency. Develop a nanofiber scaffold for cardiac applications considering the need for characteristics of an ideal tissue-engineered graft.
